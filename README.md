I am a passionate Creative Designer and Set Execution Lead with over 4 years of experience specializing in large-scale cultural and mythological event setups such as Dussehra and Maha Shivaratri. Skilled in AutoCAD, Adobe Photoshop, and visual storytelling, I bring ideas to life through precise drafting, creative mockups, and flawless execution.

My strengths include leading cross-functional teams, managing time-critical installations, and translating concepts into immersive stage and set experiences. Iâ€™ve worked across freelance projects and top firms like Amazon Logistics, where I combined coordination with creativity.

Looking to collaborate with event firms, production studios, or visual design teams to deliver impactful stage designs, installations, and branded environments.
